# ravensburger

In this assignment we had to create a memory game with React, which the user should only click an image one time. After the user clicked the image, the images would than shuffle to make the game even practical. I used a Ravensburger puzzle theme, were I took images from the Ravensburger website and also took pictures that are very similiar to each other to make the game even harder.
